The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith.  Subsequent missions, currently under consideration by NASA in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these cached samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.

NASA,Perseverance's Navcam Views Bettys Rock,https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA25658/PIA25658~large.jpg,"NASA's Perseverance Mars rover captured this image of ""Bettys Rock"" using one of the rover navigation cameras on June 20, 2022, the 474th Martian day, or sol, of the mission.  The rock is named after Bettys Rock in Shenandoah National Park.  A key objective for Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterize the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust).  Subsequent NASA missions, in cooperation with ESA (European Space Agency), would send spacecraft to Mars to collect these sealed samples from the surface and return them to Earth for in-depth analysis.
