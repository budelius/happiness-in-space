While the water they release may affect the coastal ecosystem, harmful and non-harmful algae blooms can also greatly affect the desalination plants. In particular, the local phenomenon known as the ‘red tide’ has affected desalination plants over the last four years, causing severe damage and sometimes bringing operations to a halt.Satellite data can be used to identify and monitor red tide events – such as this one spreading from the Gulf of Oman into the Persian Gulf. This image was acquired by Envisat’s MERIS instrument on 22 November 2008.",esa_images/Red tide.jpg

The caldera is outlined in white, and the lava flow produced by the eruption is also in white, stretching to the coast.Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar – or InSAR – is a technique where two or more satellite radar images over the same scene are combined to detect slight changes between them. Tiny changes on the ground cause changes in the radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured patterns in the combined image.",esa_images/Fernandina volcano.jpg
ESA,Cloud cover,https://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/09/cloud_cover/13021393-1-eng-GB/Cloud_cover_pillars.jpg,"Global annual mean cloud cover derived from three years (2007–09) of Envisat data. The map shows areas with little to no cloud coverage (blue) as well as areas that are almost always cloudy (red). Clear skies are immediately visible over deserts (such as the Sahara, Namib and over the Atacama). Regions with constant high-pressure systems are detectable, such as the Pacific. On the other hand, the North Atlantic Ocean in the mid-latitudes is mostly covered with clouds, where storms develop. The UK is often cloudy, whereas the Mediterranean shows sunny skies.Data from both the MERIS and AATSR instruments on Envisat were used.",esa_images/Cloud cover.jpg
