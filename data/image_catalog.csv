NASA_APOD,APOD Today - An Almost Everything Sky,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/EverythingSky_Koen_960.jpg,"Date: Today

This surprising sky has almost everything. 

First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the 
central band of our 
Milky Way Galaxy. 

More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in 
Earth's atmosphere is a 
bright meteor.

The dim band of light across the central diagonal is 
zodiacal light: 
sunlight reflected from 
dust in the inner 
Solar System.

The green glow on the far right is 
aurora high in 
Earth's atmosphere. 

The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom 
is just a light that was held by the scene-planning 
astrophotographer.

This ""almost everything"" 
sky was captured over rocks on 
Castle Hill, 
New Zealand 
late last month. 

The featured finished frame is a combination of 10 exposures all 
taken with the same camera and from the same location. 

But what about the astrophotographer himself?  

He's pictured too -- can you 
find him?

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-22 - Terminator Moon: A Moonscape of Shadows,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/TerminatorMoon_Addis_960.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-22

What's different about this Moon?

It's the terminators.

In the featured image, you can't directly see any 
terminator -- 
the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night.

That's because the 
featured image is a digital composite of many 
near-terminator lunar strips over a full 
Moon. 

Terminator regions show the longest and most 
prominent shadows -- shadows which, 
by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear 
three-dimensional.

The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April. 

Many of the Moon's 
craters 
stand out because of the 
shadows they all cast to the right.

The image shows in graphic detail that the 
darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the 
Moon -- they are also 
flatter.

Is this one galaxy or two?

Although it looks like one, the answer is two.

One path to this happening is when a small 
galaxy 
collides with a larger galaxy and 
ends up in the center.

But in the featured image, something more rare is going on.

Here, the central light-colored 
elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored 
spiral galaxy that surrounds it.

This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the 
near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called 
gravitational lensing.

The 
featured galaxy double was taken by the 
Webb Space Telescope 
and shows a complete 
Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.


Galaxy 
lenses like this can reveal 
new information about the 
mass distribution of the foreground lens and the 
light distribution of the background source.

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-20 - The Orion Nebula in Visible and Infrared,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_1080.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-20

The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place. 

Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small 
fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  

Long exposure, 
multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the 
Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark 
dust. 

This digital composite 
features not only three colors of 
visible light but four colors of 
infrared light taken by 
NASA's orbiting 
Spitzer Space Telescope as well. 

The power behind much of the 
Orion Nebula 
(M42) is the 
Trapezium - 
four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  

Many of the 
filamentary structures visible are actually 
shock waves - fronts 
where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. 

The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is 
located about 1500 
light years away in the same 
spiral arm of 
our Galaxy as the 
Sun.

In digital
brush strokes, Jupiter's
signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to
form this interplanetary
post-impressionist
work of art.

The creative image
from citizen scientist
Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft's JunoCam.

To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with
contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing
and an oil-painting software filter applied.

The image data was captured during
perijove 10.

That was Juno's December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system's
ruling gas giant.

At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above
northern Jovian cloud tops.

Now in an extended mission,
Juno has explored
Jupiter and its moons since entering
orbit around Jupiter in July of 2016.

In late March, the comet now designated
C/2025 F2 SWAN was
found independently by
citizen scientists
Vladimir Bezugly, Michael Mattiazzo, and Rob Matson
while examining publicly available image data
from the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) camera on
the sun-staring
SOHO spacecraft.

Comet SWAN's coma,
its greenish color a signature of diatomic carbon molecules
fluorescing in sunlight, is at lower left in
this telescopic image.

SWAN's faint ion tail extends nearly two degrees toward the upper right
across the field of view.

The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies
from June Lake, California on April 14.

Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda,
the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet.

Now a target
for binoculars and small telescopes in
northern hemisphere morning skies
this comet SWAN
is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1.

That will bring
this visitor from the distant
Oort cloud
almost as close to the Sun as the orbit of inner planet Mercury.

Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster
are scattered across this nearly 4 degree wide
telescopic field of view.

About 50 million light-years distant, the
Virgo Cluster
is the closest large galaxy cluster to our own local galaxy group.

Prominent here are Virgo's bright elliptical galaxies from the
Messier
catalog,
M87 at bottom left, and M86 and M84 near center right.

M86 and M84 are recognized as part of
Markarian's Chain,
the visually striking line-up of galaxies on the
that runs through the upper portion of this frame.

Near the middle of the chain lies an intriguing interacting pair of
galaxies, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435,
known to some as Markarian's Eyes.

Still, 
giant elliptical galaxy M87
dominates the Virgo cluster.

It's the home of a super massive black hole,
the first black hole ever imaged by planet Earth's
Event Horizon
Telescope.

NASA_APOD,APOD Today - An Almost Everything Sky,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/EverythingSky_Koen_960.jpg,"Date: Today

This surprising sky has almost everything. 

First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the 
central band of our 
Milky Way Galaxy. 

More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in 
Earth's atmosphere is a 
bright meteor.

The dim band of light across the central diagonal is 
zodiacal light: 
sunlight reflected from 
dust in the inner 
Solar System.

The green glow on the far right is 
aurora high in 
Earth's atmosphere. 

The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom 
is just a light that was held by the scene-planning 
astrophotographer.

This ""almost everything"" 
sky was captured over rocks on 
Castle Hill, 
New Zealand 
late last month. 

The featured finished frame is a combination of 10 exposures all 
taken with the same camera and from the same location. 

But what about the astrophotographer himself?  

He's pictured too -- can you 
find him?

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-22 - Terminator Moon: A Moonscape of Shadows,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/TerminatorMoon_Addis_960.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-22

What's different about this Moon?

It's the terminators.

In the featured image, you can't directly see any 
terminator -- 
the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night.

That's because the 
featured image is a digital composite of many 
near-terminator lunar strips over a full 
Moon. 

Terminator regions show the longest and most 
prominent shadows -- shadows which, 
by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear 
three-dimensional.

The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April. 

Many of the Moon's 
craters 
stand out because of the 
shadows they all cast to the right.

The image shows in graphic detail that the 
darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the 
Moon -- they are also 
flatter.

Is this one galaxy or two?

Although it looks like one, the answer is two.

One path to this happening is when a small 
galaxy 
collides with a larger galaxy and 
ends up in the center.

But in the featured image, something more rare is going on.

Here, the central light-colored 
elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored 
spiral galaxy that surrounds it.

This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the 
near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called 
gravitational lensing.

The 
featured galaxy double was taken by the 
Webb Space Telescope 
and shows a complete 
Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.


Galaxy 
lenses like this can reveal 
new information about the 
mass distribution of the foreground lens and the 
light distribution of the background source.

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-20 - The Orion Nebula in Visible and Infrared,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_1080.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-20

The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place. 

Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small 
fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  

Long exposure, 
multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the 
Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark 
dust. 

This digital composite 
features not only three colors of 
visible light but four colors of 
infrared light taken by 
NASA's orbiting 
Spitzer Space Telescope as well. 

The power behind much of the 
Orion Nebula 
(M42) is the 
Trapezium - 
four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  

Many of the 
filamentary structures visible are actually 
shock waves - fronts 
where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. 

The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is 
located about 1500 
light years away in the same 
spiral arm of 
our Galaxy as the 
Sun.

In digital
brush strokes, Jupiter's
signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to
form this interplanetary
post-impressionist
work of art.

The creative image
from citizen scientist
Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft's JunoCam.

To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with
contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing
and an oil-painting software filter applied.

The image data was captured during
perijove 10.

That was Juno's December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system's
ruling gas giant.

At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above
northern Jovian cloud tops.

Now in an extended mission,
Juno has explored
Jupiter and its moons since entering
orbit around Jupiter in July of 2016.

In late March, the comet now designated
C/2025 F2 SWAN was
found independently by
citizen scientists
Vladimir Bezugly, Michael Mattiazzo, and Rob Matson
while examining publicly available image data
from the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) camera on
the sun-staring
SOHO spacecraft.

Comet SWAN's coma,
its greenish color a signature of diatomic carbon molecules
fluorescing in sunlight, is at lower left in
this telescopic image.

SWAN's faint ion tail extends nearly two degrees toward the upper right
across the field of view.

The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies
from June Lake, California on April 14.

Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda,
the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet.

Now a target
for binoculars and small telescopes in
northern hemisphere morning skies
this comet SWAN
is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1.

That will bring
this visitor from the distant
Oort cloud
almost as close to the Sun as the orbit of inner planet Mercury.

NASA_APOD,APOD Today - An Almost Everything Sky,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/EverythingSky_Koen_960.jpg,"Date: Today

This surprising sky has almost everything. 

First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the 
central band of our 
Milky Way Galaxy. 

More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in 
Earth's atmosphere is a 
bright meteor.

The dim band of light across the central diagonal is 
zodiacal light: 
sunlight reflected from 
dust in the inner 
Solar System.

The green glow on the far right is 
aurora high in 
Earth's atmosphere. 

The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom 
is just a light that was held by the scene-planning 
astrophotographer.

This ""almost everything"" 
sky was captured over rocks on 
Castle Hill, 
New Zealand 
late last month. 

The featured finished frame is a combination of 10 exposures all 
taken with the same camera and from the same location. 

But what about the astrophotographer himself?  

He's pictured too -- can you 
find him?

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-22 - Terminator Moon: A Moonscape of Shadows,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/TerminatorMoon_Addis_960.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-22

What's different about this Moon?

It's the terminators.

In the featured image, you can't directly see any 
terminator -- 
the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night.

That's because the 
featured image is a digital composite of many 
near-terminator lunar strips over a full 
Moon. 

Terminator regions show the longest and most 
prominent shadows -- shadows which, 
by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear 
three-dimensional.

The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April. 

Many of the Moon's 
craters 
stand out because of the 
shadows they all cast to the right.

The image shows in graphic detail that the 
darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the 
Moon -- they are also 
flatter.

Is this one galaxy or two?

Although it looks like one, the answer is two.

One path to this happening is when a small 
galaxy 
collides with a larger galaxy and 
ends up in the center.

But in the featured image, something more rare is going on.

Here, the central light-colored 
elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored 
spiral galaxy that surrounds it.

This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the 
near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called 
gravitational lensing.

The 
featured galaxy double was taken by the 
Webb Space Telescope 
and shows a complete 
Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.


Galaxy 
lenses like this can reveal 
new information about the 
mass distribution of the foreground lens and the 
light distribution of the background source.

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-20 - The Orion Nebula in Visible and Infrared,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_1080.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-20

The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place. 

Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small 
fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  

Long exposure, 
multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the 
Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark 
dust. 

This digital composite 
features not only three colors of 
visible light but four colors of 
infrared light taken by 
NASA's orbiting 
Spitzer Space Telescope as well. 

The power behind much of the 
Orion Nebula 
(M42) is the 
Trapezium - 
four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  

Many of the 
filamentary structures visible are actually 
shock waves - fronts 
where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. 

The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is 
located about 1500 
light years away in the same 
spiral arm of 
our Galaxy as the 
Sun.

In digital
brush strokes, Jupiter's
signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to
form this interplanetary
post-impressionist
work of art.

The creative image
from citizen scientist
Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft's JunoCam.

To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with
contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing
and an oil-painting software filter applied.

The image data was captured during
perijove 10.

That was Juno's December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system's
ruling gas giant.

At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above
northern Jovian cloud tops.

Now in an extended mission,
Juno has explored
Jupiter and its moons since entering
orbit around Jupiter in July of 2016.

In late March, the comet now designated
C/2025 F2 SWAN was
found independently by
citizen scientists
Vladimir Bezugly, Michael Mattiazzo, and Rob Matson
while examining publicly available image data
from the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) camera on
the sun-staring
SOHO spacecraft.

Comet SWAN's coma,
its greenish color a signature of diatomic carbon molecules
fluorescing in sunlight, is at lower left in
this telescopic image.

SWAN's faint ion tail extends nearly two degrees toward the upper right
across the field of view.

The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies
from June Lake, California on April 14.

Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda,
the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet.

Now a target
for binoculars and small telescopes in
northern hemisphere morning skies
this comet SWAN
is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1.

That will bring
this visitor from the distant
Oort cloud
almost as close to the Sun as the orbit of inner planet Mercury.

The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom 
is just a light that was held by the scene-planning 
astrophotographer.

This ""almost everything"" 
sky was captured over rocks on 
Castle Hill, 
New Zealand 
late last month. 

The featured finished frame is a combination of 10 exposures all 
taken with the same camera and from the same location. 

But what about the astrophotographer himself?  

He's pictured too -- can you 
find him?

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-22 - Terminator Moon: A Moonscape of Shadows,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/TerminatorMoon_Addis_960.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-22

What's different about this Moon?

It's the terminators.

In the featured image, you can't directly see any 
terminator -- 
the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night.

That's because the 
featured image is a digital composite of many 
near-terminator lunar strips over a full 
Moon. 

Terminator regions show the longest and most 
prominent shadows -- shadows which, 
by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear 
three-dimensional.

The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April. 

Many of the Moon's 
craters 
stand out because of the 
shadows they all cast to the right.

The image shows in graphic detail that the 
darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the 
Moon -- they are also 
flatter.

Is this one galaxy or two?

Although it looks like one, the answer is two.

One path to this happening is when a small 
galaxy 
collides with a larger galaxy and 
ends up in the center.

But in the featured image, something more rare is going on.

Here, the central light-colored 
elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored 
spiral galaxy that surrounds it.

This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the 
near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called 
gravitational lensing.

The 
featured galaxy double was taken by the 
Webb Space Telescope 
and shows a complete 
Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.


Galaxy 
lenses like this can reveal 
new information about the 
mass distribution of the foreground lens and the 
light distribution of the background source.

NASA_APOD,APOD 2025-04-20 - The Orion Nebula in Visible and Infrared,https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/M42_SpitzerCzernetz_1080.jpg,"Date: 2025-04-20

The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place. 

Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small 
fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.  

Long exposure, 
multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the 
Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark 
dust. 

This digital composite 
features not only three colors of 
visible light but four colors of 
infrared light taken by 
NASA's orbiting 
Spitzer Space Telescope as well. 

The power behind much of the 
Orion Nebula 
(M42) is the 
Trapezium - 
four of the brightest stars in the nebula.  

Many of the 
filamentary structures visible are actually 
shock waves - fronts 
where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas. 

The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is 
located about 1500 
light years away in the same 
spiral arm of 
our Galaxy as the 
Sun.

In digital
brush strokes, Jupiter's
signature atmospheric bands and vortices were used to
form this interplanetary
post-impressionist
work of art.

The creative image
from citizen scientist
Rick Lundh uses data from the Juno spacecraft's JunoCam.

To paint on the digital canvas, a JunoCam image with
contrasting light and dark tones was chosen for processing
and an oil-painting software filter applied.

The image data was captured during
perijove 10.

That was Juno's December 16, 2017 close encounter with the solar system's
ruling gas giant.

At the time the spacecraft was cruising about 13,000 kilometers above
northern Jovian cloud tops.

Now in an extended mission,
Juno has explored
Jupiter and its moons since entering
orbit around Jupiter in July of 2016.

In late March, the comet now designated
C/2025 F2 SWAN was
found independently by
citizen scientists
Vladimir Bezugly, Michael Mattiazzo, and Rob Matson
while examining publicly available image data
from the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) camera on
the sun-staring
SOHO spacecraft.

Comet SWAN's coma,
its greenish color a signature of diatomic carbon molecules
fluorescing in sunlight, is at lower left in
this telescopic image.

SWAN's faint ion tail extends nearly two degrees toward the upper right
across the field of view.

The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies
from June Lake, California on April 14.

Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda,
the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet.

Now a target
for binoculars and small telescopes in
northern hemisphere morning skies
this comet SWAN
is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1.

That will bring
this visitor from the distant
Oort cloud
almost as close to the Sun as the orbit of inner planet Mercury.

Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster
are scattered across this nearly 4 degree wide
telescopic field of view.

About 50 million light-years distant, the
Virgo Cluster
is the closest large galaxy cluster to our own local galaxy group.

Prominent here are Virgo's bright elliptical galaxies from the
Messier
catalog,
M87 at bottom left, and M86 and M84 near center right.

M86 and M84 are recognized as part of
Markarian's Chain,
the visually striking line-up of galaxies on the
that runs through the upper portion of this frame.

Near the middle of the chain lies an intriguing interacting pair of
galaxies, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435,
known to some as Markarian's Eyes.

Still, 
giant elliptical galaxy M87
dominates the Virgo cluster.

It's the home of a super massive black hole,
the first black hole ever imaged by planet Earth's
Event Horizon
Telescope.
